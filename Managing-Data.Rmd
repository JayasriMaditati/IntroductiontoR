## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. A cheat sheet can be found at https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf.

**Reference:** Code in this document comes from [R in Action, Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-third-edition?)

## An Example
```{r}
manager <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
date <- c("10/24/08", "10/28/08", "10/1/08", "10/12/08", "5/1/09") 
country <- c("US", "US", "UK", "UK", "UK") 
gender <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "F")
age <- c(32, 45, 25, 39, 99) 
q1 <- c(5, 3, 3, 3, 2) 
q2 <- c(4, 5, 5, 3, 2) 
q3 <- c(5, 2, 5, 4, 1) 
q4 <- c(5, 5, 5, NA, 2) 
q5 <- c(5, 5, 2, NA, 1)
leadership <- data.frame(manager, date, country, gender, age, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
